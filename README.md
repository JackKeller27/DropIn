Welcome to DropIn! This is a react-native application geared towards skaters which allows users to pin different locations on a map and upload media (tricks!) to those pins.\
\
Below are some additional frameworks used in conjuction with our app:
- Google Cloud APIs (Google Maps): https://console.cloud.google.com/billing/enable?flow=maps&project=dropin-366306&redirect=%2Fgoogle%2Fmaps-apis%2Fwelcome%3Fproject%3Ddropin-366306%26step%3Djust_ask&redirectOnCancel=https:%2F%2Fcloud.google.com%2Fmaps-platform%2F
- MongoDB: https://cloud.mongodb.com/v2/63545333a469d65b52d17ea9#clusters
- Heroku
- Flask



Don't worry, we're not finished! A few additional functionalities we intend to implement include:
- Ability to save media uploads.
- Ability to view other user's uploads (not just pins)
- "Like" or rating system for posted tricks


Check back in for any updates!
